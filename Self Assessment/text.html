		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

		<p>The giant squid (genus: <em>Architeuthis</em>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as 
		many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <em>Deep-sea gigantism</em>): recent estimates put the 
		maximum size at 13 m (<em>43 ft</em>) for females and 10 m (<em>33 ft</em>) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long 
		tentacles (<strong>second only to the colossal squid</strong> at an estimated 14 m (<em>46 ft</em>), one of the largest living organisms). The 
		mantle is about 2 m (<em>6.6 ft</em>) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles 
		is about 5 m (<em>16 ft</em>). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (<em>66 ft</em>) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
		
		<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> 
		took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of 
		the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid <strong>for the 
		first time</strong> on <em>4 December 2006.</em></p>
