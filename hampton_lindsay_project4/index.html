	<section id="rules">
		<h2>GAME RULES</h2>
				<p>
					Each <strong><abbr title="National Hockey League">NHL</abbr> regulation game</strong> is played between two teams and is <em>60 minutes long</em>. The game is composed of <em>three 20-minute periods</em> with an intermission of either 15½ or 17 minutes (if nationally televised) between periods. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Television timeouts are taken at the first stoppage of play after 6, 10, and 14 minutes of elapsed time of each of the three regulation periods, unless a <em>power play </em>is in session at the time or the first stoppage is the result of a goal scored. In these cases, the timeout will occur at the first stoppage after the penalty expires or the next stoppage after the goal, respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					 A rule that was introduced in the 2007–08 season was that if the first stoppage of play after said time periods is an icing call, the TV timeout will not occur. This rule was added shortly after the league instituted a rule that disallows the team who ices the puck to substitute their players on the ice at the time of the icing. The rule was added so that a TV timeout would not compromise the inability to be substituted.
				</p>
				<p>
					  At the end of the 60-minute regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, overtime ensues. During the regular season, <strong>overtime is a five-minute, four-player on four-player sudden-death period, in which the first team to score a goal wins the game.</strong>

	<!-- SECTION 3 ~ ORIGINS -->	
	<section id="teams">
		<h2>NHL ORIGINS</h2>
			<p>
				The National Hockey League originated in <em>1917</em> with four Canadian teams, which after a tumultuous first quarter century, found stability in the <strong>Original Six</strong> era spanning 1942–67 with four franchises in the United States joining two Canadian clubs. Through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations the NHL currently consists of <em>30 teams</em>, 23 of which are based in the United States and seven in Canada.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				The NHL is the only major league team in North America that fields teams playing in the capital cities of two countries. These capital cities being:
			</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Washington, DC.</li>
				<li>Ottawa, Ontario.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The current <em>30-team NHL organization</em> divides the teams into <em>two conferences</em>: the <strong>Eastern Conference</strong> and the <strong>Western Conference.</strong> Each conference is split into two divisions:<em> the Eastern Conference contains 16 teams </em>(eight per division), while <em>the Western Conference has 14 teams </em>(seven per division). Sixteen of the league's thirty teams (the entire Eastern Conference) are located in the Eastern Time Zone. On the other hand, the Western Conference has six teams in the Central Time Zone, and 4 each in the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones. Up until the 2012–13 season, the <em>Detroit Red Wings</em> and<em> Columbus Blue Jackets</em> were the only Eastern Time teams in the Western Conference, and <em>Winnipeg Jets</em> was the only non-Eastern Time team in the Eastern Conference (a temporary alignment resulting from the franchise's move out of Atlanta in 2011).<br><br>
